# Predict-Your-Future-Income-Using-Python-and-Machine-Learning.ipynb

Utilized pandas, numpy, the train_test_split module from sklearn.model_selection, Gradient Boositing Classifier from sklearn.ensemble, seaborn and matplotlib libraries to extract, load, and transform U.S. Census Bureau salary data. Conducted tests on primary data frame, created a correlated number list of columns to keep from the categorical columns to train and test, split the data set into a feature or independent data set (x) and a target or dependent data set (y), split the data again in 80% training and 20% testing data sets, created and trained the model, displayed model score on the training and testing data sets, created a function to convert the data to number values, converted the categorical varibale to numbers for the model, and made the prediction to display the income type model each person would have.
